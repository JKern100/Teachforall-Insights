João: The onboarding process has been smooth. We've implemented the new training modules you recommended last month.

Jeff: That's excellent news. How are the new teachers performing?

Maria: Very well actually. The retention rate is at 92%, which is above our historical average of 85%.

João: We've also received positive feedback from the schools. They appreciate the additional support we're providing.

Jeff: Great work. Let's discuss the challenges you're facing with the curriculum implementation.

Maria: The main challenge is adapting the curriculum to rural areas. We need more resources for remote communities.

Jeff: That sounds promising. Keep me updated on the progress. Also, let me know if you need any support from the global network.

Maria: Will do. Thank you for your continued support.
